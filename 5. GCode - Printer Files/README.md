# ShieldsUp GCODE Files
### Arranged by printer type to facilitate novice users getting going quickly

## Format of file names to maintain sense, and sorting:

* _Machine Code_ -Cura assigns three characters, i.e. Creality Ender 3 -> CE3 (we need this so we know what multiple files named the same are for)
* _File Name Printed_
* _Xup_ (number of frames in the print, omitted equals 1) 
* _Layer Height_
* _IF Setting_
* _Adhesion_ (N=none, S=Skirt, B=Brim, R=Raft)
* _Filament Type_
* _Speed_
* _Hours Minutes_

ie. CE3_Shields_Up_Project_-_SUP_V2__2up_0.2_if30_S_PLA_50mm-s_4h58mins.gcode
* Creality Ender 3
* Shields_Up_Project_-_SUP_V2
* 2 Frames in the print
* 0.20mm layer height
* Infill 30%
* Skirt
* PLA filament
* 50mm/s print speed
* 4hours 58 minutes expected print time.

* gcode files can misbehave on some machines, even when they have been created for your make and model, please watch what it is doing to ensure that it is working as expected. Do Not set and forget until you know it works correctly.
* Do Not use a gcode file from a different printer to yours you may damage your machine.
