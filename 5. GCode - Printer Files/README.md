Arranged by printer type to facilitate novice users getting going quickly

Format of file names to maintain sense, and sorting:

Machine Code -Cura assigns three characters, i.e. Creality Ender 3 -> CE3 (we need this so we know what multiple files names the same are for)
_File_Name_Printed_
_Layer Height_
_IF Setting_
_Adhesion_ (N=none, S=Skirt, B=Brim, R=Raft)
_Hours_Minutes

ie. CE3_Shields_Up_Project_-_SUP_V1.2_0.2_if30_4h58mins.gcode
