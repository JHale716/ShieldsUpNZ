Arranged by printer type to facilitate novice users getting going quickly

Format of file names to maintain sense, and sorting:

Machine Code -Cura assigns three characters, i.e. Creality Ender 3 -> CE3 (we need this so we know what multiple files named the same are for)
_File_Name_Printed_
_Xup_ (number of frames in the print, omitted equals 1) 
_Layer Height_
_IF Setting_
_Adhesion_ (N=none, S=Skirt, B=Brim, R=Raft)
_Filament Type_
_Speed_
_Hours_Minutes

ie. CE3_Shields_Up_Project_-_SUP_V2__2up_0.2_if30_S_PLA_50mm-s_4h58mins.gcode
