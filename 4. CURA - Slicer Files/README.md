# ShieldsUp
#### Arranged by printer type to facilitate novice users getting going quickly

Format of file names to maintain sense, and sorting:
* Machine Code -Cura assigns three characters, i.e. Creality Ender 3 -> CE3_ (we need this so we know what multiple files names the same are for)
* File_Name_Printed_
* Layer Height_
* Infill Setting_
* Adhesion (N=none, S=Skirt, B=Brim, R=Raft)

ie. CE3_Shields_Up_Project_-_SUP_V1.2_0.2_N.
