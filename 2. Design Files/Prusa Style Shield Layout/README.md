Hey guys. Geting serious about the visors here for a second. Please see files attached to this post for nested shared line DXF files suitable for laser cutting for the Prusa style shield frame.
I have created two versions of each for both 0.5mm PetG and 0.75mm PetG. The only difference is with the 0.75mm file i have moved the outside holes out by 0.5mm to make it easier to fit onto the Prusa style frame.
2440x1220 full size sheet will yield 50 visors
800x1220 will yield 15 visors (45 per sheet)
Use them, share them.
