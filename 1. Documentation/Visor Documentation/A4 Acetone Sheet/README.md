Thomas Everth worked out something cool: 

You can make plastic visors for the headband using A4 clear binding cover sheets and an office hole punch! 

The two outer pins are actually at exactly the right distance of the two holes made by an office hole punch. So all you need to do is:

- Take an A4 clear sheet in landscape mode. 
- Mark the middle. 
- Mark off 7cm either side of that as a centre marker for the hole punch. 
- Then punch two sets of holes. Done!
- Here is a template. 
- Measurements correct. 
- But drawing not to scale. 
- In seconds you can stamp out a box full or visors to fit the headband.
