Thomas Everth worked out something cool: 

A4 Clear Plastic Cover Solution

You can make plastic visors for the headband using A4 clear binding cover sheets and an office hole punch! The two outer pins are actually at exactly the right distance of the two holes made by an office hole punch. 

Tools required:
Standard 2 hole hole punch
A4 Card for template
Pen
Wipe off marker, white board or wine glass marker (wine glass market in the video)
Ruler
Scissors

One thing I did not cover in the video is the need to trim off the corners on the bottom once finished, they can be sharp and quite pokey... 

So all you need to do is:

Take an A4 clear sheet in landscape mode. 
Mark the middle. 
Mark off 7cm either side of that as a centre marker for the hole punch. 
Then punch two sets of holes. Done!
Here is a template. 

Measurements correct. 
Drawing not to scale. 
In seconds you can stamp out a box full or visors to fit the headband.
