# Ender 3/3 Pro (Same machine for printing purposes) 

## PLA 0.4mm print nozzle 
* eSun PLA & PLA+ various colours
* 205°C hotend
* 62°C bed
* Cooling fan on
* 0.2mm layer height
* 0.4mm layer width/nozzle
* 80mm/s speed
* 30% infill
* Cubic infill pattern - strong and print speed neutral to other settings.

4 hours 06 mins actual printing time just the headband

## PETg 0.4mm print nozzle 
* Marvle3D PETg in Yellow
* 240°C hotend
* 69°C bed
* Cooling fan 50%
* 0.2mm layer height
* 0.4mm layer width/nozzle
* 60mm/s speed
* 30% infill
* Cubic infill pattern - strong and print speed neutral to other settings.

3 hours 36 mins actual printing time just the headband

## Experimental settings:

### Increase Layer Height: 0.30mm
* Marvle3D PETg in Yellow
* No infill
* Issues discovered, extruder skipping and nozzle jamming
* Increase temp - 260°C didn't improve
* Increased stringing and layer seperation.
* 60mm/s print speed inner and outer walls
* Projected Print Time 1 hour 08 minutes

### Increase Layer Height: 0.27mm
* Marvle3D PETg in Yellow
* No infill
* Issues discovered, extruder skipping
* Increase temp - 260°C didn't improve
* Increased stringing and layer seperation.
* 50mm/s print speed inner and outer walls
* Projected Print Time 1 hour 24 minutes

### Increase Layer Height: 0.25mm
* Marvle3D PETg in Yellow
* No infill 
* Issues discovered, extruder skipping
* Increase temp - 255°C extruder skipping stopped
* Increased stringing and layer seperation, 1st run, though with less walls and standard layer width, 0.40mm. Poor strength.
* 50mm/s print speed inner and outer walls
* Projected Print Time 1 hour 32 minutes
* Rerunning with 4 layer walls same setting
* Projected Print Time 1 hour 52 minutes. Projected 1.5 hour saving in time. 

### Less walls and over extruding 0.25mm, 0.27mm, & 0.30mm layer heights
* Marvle3D PETg in Yellow
* 0.60mm layer width, 3 walls instead of 4.
* Issues discovered, extruder skipping (all) and nozzle jamming (0.30mm)
* Increase temp - 260°C didn't improve
* Weaker construction, layer seperation and easily damaged. Almost brittle.


### Conclusions:
* Increase outer wall speed to printing speed, most effective increase in speed
* Increase layer height, needs increase in Hotend Temp for extruder to keep up.
