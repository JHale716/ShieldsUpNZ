# ShieldsUp
UPBox+ Settings from Jamie Boorman

Layer Height .25mm
Density: 25% (I'm quite limited by settings available)
Nozzle: .4mm

I'm using the latest STL and am cranking out a headband and bottom reinforcer every 2.5 hours. 
I could possibly speed that up, but it is running nice and stable and don't want to foul it up!!
